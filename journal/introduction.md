In the contemporary digital age, individuals exhibit distinct preferences for the format of content they engage with. This diversity in preference can be attributed to various factors, including cognitive styles, learning preferences, and accessibility needs. Consequently, the ability to consume content in a preferred format can significantly enhance the user's comprehension, engagement, and overall learning experience. Tailoring content presentation to individual preferences not only respects user diversity but also optimizes the information absorption process, thereby maximizing the benefits derived from the content.

Regrettably, the vast expanse of the web does not always cater to the diverse format preferences of its users. Content creators and providers, while pivotal in the information dissemination process, cannot be reasonably expected to shoulder the burden of producing content in multiple formats from the outset. This expectation not only imposes an additional strain on the content production process but also detracts from the primary focus of generating quality content. Therefore, the onus of accommodating diverse format preferences cannot solely rest on the content creators, necessitating the development of adaptive systems that can bridge this gap.

In light of these considerations, the necessity for a system that can expedite the information retrieval process for users becomes apparent. Such a system would not only streamline the search process but also enhance the user experience by delivering precise and relevant information in response to user queries. This would significantly reduce the time and effort expended by users in sifting through an overwhelming amount of web content, thereby making the pursuit of information more efficient and less daunting.

The application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques presents a promising avenue for the development of such adaptive systems. However, the sophistication of these applications necessitates the use of advanced algorithms and tools, which may pose significant challenges.

Fortunately, the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the proliferation of open-source LLMs have provided us with powerful tools to overcome these challenges. These models, trained on vast amounts of text data, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text.

A prime example of this is the GPT-4 model, a state-of-the-art LLM that has shown unprecedented performance in tasks such as translation, question-answering, and even content generation in preferred formats. Moreover, GPT-4's capabilities extend beyond text, with the model demonstrating proficiency in multimodal tasks, such as image generation. This underscores the potential of LLMs in revolutionizing the way we search for and consume information on the web.

We have chosen to explore and harness the capabilities of an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) known as Llama 2. This model, generously made available by Meta, offers a range of configurations, including 7B, 13B, and 70B parameter models, thereby providing a spectrum of computational and performance trade-offs to suit various application requirements. Llama 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of NLP tasks, including summarization and question-answering.

The next sections of this paper will discuss the design and implementation of the Search Engine Summarizer (SES), a system that utilizes Llama 2 to deliver search results in the format preferred by the user. The system is built utilizing Pre-trained Language models and fine-tuned with datasets of various format of content. We are going to explore whether having distinct models for various document types has considerable benefits. We want ensuring both high quality and versatility. The system's primary objective is to ascertain context and deliver relevant outcomes that address the user's inquiry or requirement. The goal of this effort is to create a system that facilitates the rapid and effective discovery of information for scholars, students, teachers, and the general public.
