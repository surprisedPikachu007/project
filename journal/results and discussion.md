The system was evaluated using a variety of query strings, including 'Cricket' and 'India', and user satisfaction was assessed by fellow stuednts testing the system. Feedback indicated that while this approach necessitates a greater allocation of resources compared to libraries implementing traditional Natural Language Processing techniques for Extractive and Abstractive summarization, the trade-off for coherent and concise summaries was deemed worthwhile. The overall quality of the summaries was rated as satisfactory. However, the system demonstrated limitations when dealing with articles of substantial length, particularly those exceeding 600 words. The quality of the summaries declined in these instances, primarily because the model failed to account for all significant events. This could be attributed to the model's lack of environmental or political awareness, which limits its ability to discern the importance of different events. Despite these limitations, the potential for improvement is evident. With further fine-tuning and the incorporation of human feedback, these shortcomings can be addressed.
