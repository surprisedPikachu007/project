This paper presents the development of a system designed to streamline the process of information retrieval during search or research sessions. The system achieves this by transforming the available format of information into a format that aligns with the user's needs. As an initial step towards our ultimate goal of creating a summarizer for search engine results, we developed a simple system for summarizing news articles. We employed Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to fine-tune a large language model on a dataset of over 1,000 samples. To make the training process feasible on freely available hardware, we utilized the QLoRA technique for quantization. The results of the study demonstrated that satisfactory outcomes can be achieved without the need for sophisticated hardware or software. The limitations observed during the study provide avenues for further exploration and improvement. Moreover, the results obtained offer valuable insights into the direction we should take in the next phase of development.
