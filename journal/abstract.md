Abstract - Today's world is powered by information, and the internet is brimming with both organized and unstructured data. Search engines serve as a portal for searching for and retrieving information. A normal search engine returns a list of links to web pages present in the web. To access the information they need, the user must click on each of these links and sift through them. This procedure is inefficient and time-consuming. We describe the Search Engine Summarizer in this paper, which is a system that accepts a query and provides a result set in the format the user desires. For example succint summaries, key points etc., The system is built utilizing Pre-trained Language models and fine-tuned with datasets of various format of content. We are going to explore whether having distinct models for various document types has considerable benefits. We want ensuring both high quality and versatility. The system's primary objective is to ascertain context and deliver relevant outcomes that address the user's inquiry or requirement. The goal of this effort is to create a system that facilitates the rapid and effective discovery of information for scholars, students, teachers, and the general public.
